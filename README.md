Dive into _Hook-A-Fish!_ Inspired by childhood memories, you will face a fun, fast-paced fishing challenge against the clock.

The goal is simple: catch as many fish as you can. Each fish you catch gives you extra time, and you can share your results with friends to challenge them.

npm run build
```
